            resume. With solid experience in frontend languages like html, css and javascript through my job with Malhub, I am
            sure that I can quickly become a strong asset to your team.

                    My background in frontend includes completing various tasks and responsibilities, such as building templates,
                brainstorming designs and working with the team. In addition, I have consistently demonstrated a steadfast
                commitment to ensuring cyber security by adhering to site safety. For the past two years with Malhub, I have on
                several projects. I am committed to ensuring the highest quality of customer service by overseeing prompt delivery
                of all tasks.
